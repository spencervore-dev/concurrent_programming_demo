This repository is my recreation from memory of the multi-threaded examples show in the Concurrent and Parallel Programming in Python course: 
https://www.udemy.com/course/concurrent-and-parallel-programming-in-python/  

I wanted to get some hands on experience with some of the basic Python multithreading and parallel libraries.  

This code was run using Python 3.12. Then pip install -r requirements.txt.  

NOTE: The code in this example is solely inspired by the Udemy training course and doesn't contain any confidential information or anything work related.
